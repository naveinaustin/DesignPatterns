Design Patterns
====================
This Repo will have the Design Patterns that I have been working on. Some of them have Design Patterns implemented in Javascript. 

The folders contain design patterns implemented as in the Head First Design Patterns book. These are in the folder "headfirstdesignpatterns"

Following Patterns Implemented in Java:
- Builder
- Factory (Javascript included) - This has two implementations, one a simple factory. The other implemented to follow the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Factory method
- Module pattern (Only Javascript)
- Singleton (Javascript included)
- Strategy
